# Introduction

## Background and Motivation

The World food programme estimated that more than 7.7 million people in Zimbabwe - half the population - would face food insecurity in 2020. Zimbabwe is not ranked on the Global Hunger Index (because of lack of data) but the 2022 provisional severity is designated as "Serious", a designation carried from as far as 2019. Previously (2017), Zimbabwe has ranked as high as 108 out of 119 countries with the situation exarcebated by economic instability, rising inflation, high unemployment and recurrent erratic climate. This is in stark contrast to 1980, when Zimbabwe was known as the breadbasket of Africa. The situation is most dire in rural areas.

The goal of this study was:

-   to find out how food security & related statistics vary across different regions in Zimbabwe
-   to show the presence (or lack thereof) of the dissonace between rural and urban districts when it comes to poverty rates and food (in)security
-   how these patterns relate or correlate to election patterns

# About the Data

The Poverty Rate, Efficiency and Potential data were obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations' (FAO) HiH Agricultural Typologies Datasets.

The shapefiles used to plot the maps were obtained from the Humanitarian Data Exchange, an open data sharing platform managed by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

The election data table and map were scraped (with permission) from Wikipedia.

The population data was scraped (with permission) from the ZimStat, the Zimbabwean National Statistics Agency.

### Potential

Potential is defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization as " providing the maximum agricultural income smallholders in a region can attain if performing at maximum capacity (their own, as well as of the markets, productive infrastructure, and basic services surrounding them). Agricultural income potential is determined by both the biophysical factors that impact agricultural production and the economic factors that influence crop prices. Under perfect conditions, it is the interaction of these two sets of elements that establishes the maximum income a farmer can earn from agricultural activities. To increase their agricultural income potential, farmers require long-term R&D investments that completely shift the productive paradigm through technological change."

distpotential_map <- st_as_sf(distpotential_map)

                domain = distpoverty_map$potential,
                na.color = "transparent",
                bins = bins)

distlabels <- paste(
  "District: ", distpotential_map$district, "<br/>",
  "Province: ", distpotential_map$province, "<br/>",
  "Potential: ", distpotential_map$potential) %>% 
  lapply(htmltools::HTML)

leaflet() %>% 
  addPolygons(data = distpotential_map,
              fillColor = ~mypal(potential),
              stroke = TRUE,
              fillOpacity = 0.5,
              color = 'White',
              weight = 1.5,
              label = distlabels) %>% 
    addLegend(data = distpotential_map,
            "bottomleft",

            values = ~potential,
            title = "Potential",
            opacity = 1)

```

### Efficiency

On the other hand, the Food and Agriculture Organization defines Efficiency as "how much of the potential is attained by farmers in a region under current conditions. To increase their efficiency, farmers need to reduce transaction costs in agricultural production and marketing through improved infrastructure (such as roads) and services (such as market information), overcome market failures (access to credit, insurance, land markets, etc.), and receive better access to basic services (such as education and extension services)."

```

We also decided to look at a plot of a combination of these factors. The classification of the regions was obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization and we decided to pair it with population data from the 2022 census to see the number of people being impacted in the classified regions.

### Region Classification

The plot below is a combination of the three factors mentioned above having been broken down into seven classification groups.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
combo_map <- st_as_sf(combo_map)

mypal <- colorFactor(viridis(7), 
                domain = combo_map$cat_tercil,
                na.color = "transparent")

distlabels <- paste(
  "District: ",combo_map$district, "<br/>",
  "Province: ", combo_map$province, "<br/>",
  "Potential: ", combo_map$cat_tercil) %>% 
  lapply(htmltools::HTML)

leaflet() %>% 
  addPolygons(data = combo_map,
              fillColor = ~mypal(cat_tercil),
              stroke = TRUE,
              fillOpacity = 0.5,
              color = 'White',
              weight = 1.5,
              label = distlabels) %>% 
     addLegend(data = combo_map,
            "bottomleft",
            pal = mypal,
            values = ~cat_tercil,
            title = "Classification",
            opacity = 1)

```

### Region Population

```{r, echo=FALSE}
district_pop_map <- st_as_sf(district_pop_map)

bins <- c(0,10000, 50000, 100000,150000, 200000, 250000, 350000,400000, 700000, 1500000)

### Poverty Rate

The Food and Agriculture Organization classifies its use of the poverty rate as follows: " The Priority component portrays a region's degree of urgency for investments in development, measured in terms of the wellbeing of the local population and the ultimate target beneficiaries of agricultural innovation efforts. In this analysis, poverty rates have been used as the preferred measure of regional welfare, because of their availability and consistent measurement."

```{r, echo=FALSE}
distpoverty_map <- st_as_sf(distpoverty_map)

mypal <- colorNumeric(
  palette = "YlOrRd",
  domain = distpoverty_map$poverty_rate,
  na.color = "transparent")

distlabels <- paste(
  "District: ", distpoverty_map$district, "<br/>",
  "Province: ", distpoverty_map$province, "<br/>",
  "Poverty Rate: ", distpoverty_map$poverty_rate) %>% 
  lapply(htmltools::HTML)

leaflet() %>% 
  addPolygons(data = distpoverty_map,
              fillColor = ~mypal(poverty_rate),
              stroke = TRUE,
              fillOpacity = 0.5,
              color = 'White',
              weight = 1.5,
              label = distlabels) %>% 
  addLegend(data = distpoverty_map,
            "bottomleft",
            pal = mypal,
            values = ~poverty_rate,
            title = "Poverty Rate",
